Should a tool-board magic smoke come out because of user error? Why?

Should a tool-board be destroyed by a fault in your 3D printer? Why?

My answer is NO! And this is what this tool-board is all about! 

We are hobbits, professionals and let’s face it, we do mistakes, and when the magic smoke shows up everybody is disappointed, even if we know it’s a user fault. In this board, I promise you the magic smoke is kept inside extremely tight!
